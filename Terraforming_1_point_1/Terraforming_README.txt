IV: Guide To Playing

The basics: By shaping the terrain, you gain or lose favor with elements, in addition to the geographical effects. Think of it like a game-within-the-game to get special elemental benefits for your terraforming.

Start simple: Pick an element, and start saving up mana. Start creating the terrain associated with that element, and you'll gain its "favor," represented by an associated resource. Use this resource to cast powerful spells, enchant units, get unique and useful items/equipment, or build the element-specific structures in your cities.

One benefit to terraforming is that you can build up elemental power in your chosen element(s). Place a lot of Burning Lands, and soon you can rack up extra Fire Power to boost fire spells. If you get a hero to Level 4 and 5 of the Elemental Magic skill, some very useful and powerful spells are unlocked (but you'll have to have terraformed to cast them).

Go even further: use the terrain to create "walls" around your territory. Burning Lands won't slow down enemy armies, but Hungering Fire can be cast in burning lands, and can quickly turn your enemies to a pile of ashes. Forest slows down the enemy, and you can use Keep Away From The Trees! to do damage to armies while in forest.

Earth and Water have the most map-changing potential, as they can ultimately create mountains and oceans most units cannot pass.

V: Thanks

Thanks to fsemprini for his incredible work with the graphics. 

Thanks to Brad and Derek for making the game and its engine full of hidden features. Also thanks to Brad for his work on the upcoming Sorcerer King, which taught me things about this game's engine I could only learn from another game that used it. 

Thanks to Heavenfall, parrotmath, Primal_Savage, abob101, and all the modders or mod players who have helped me learn to mod and tweak this game engine.
