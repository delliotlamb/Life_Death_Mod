V. GUIDE TO THE SORCERER

The Sorcerer has access to interesting Strategic spells only he can cast. He can manipulate the map in various ways that may empower your faction. He can also do some light terraforming, if you lack other terraforming spells.

Your Sorcerer can cast 'Year Of Meditation' to gain experience passively. Also, if you build a Sorcerer's Tower, a Sorcerer in that city can cast Magical Experiment, which will next a random reward of either experience, research, or mana. Assuming it doesn't go horribly wrong, of course! 

If you keep your Sorcerer as a tactical caster, he is an interesting alternative to a mage. His spells are slow, but more likely to take effect and hit harder. He doesn't get a mana cost discount.

If you get the Summon Meteor spell, I dare you to cast it and not win that battle!

A Mage and a Sorcerer together in a fight may be the ultimate spell casting team...
