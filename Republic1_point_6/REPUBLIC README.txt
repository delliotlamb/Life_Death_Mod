Thanks for downloading the Republic Faction Ability mod! This mod includes the Republic Government faction ability, the Secret Knowledge Society Ability, and Merit Before Blood ability. Once installed, you are free to create custom factions with these abilities. 

Also included is the Carian Republic, a faction that uses all three, and the Level 6 and 7 cities mod. 

This mod is 'modular,' meaning each component listed above lives in its own file, if you would like to pick and choose which will be a part of your game.


Feedback and bug reports are always welcome! See the Legendary Heroes forum thread here:

Step 0: Delete the old version, if any!

Step 1: Unpack the .rar file into your Legendary Heroes Mods folder.

"Documents > MyGames > LegendaryHeroes > Mods"

Step 2: Make sure "use mods" is selected in the games preference file. If not, toggle this setting and re-start the game.

2. GUIDEB
First- build a public forum. Always, every time. It gives you all your economic benefits, and lets you overcome the crippling initial unrest.

Second- Grow your cities. The public forum gives a growth boost, so throw everything into food and then growth. You can get level 4 cities fast as a Republic, and you probably need them. Substitiuting city size with city count isn't an option here. Unless you uninstalled the mod component, you can get to level 6 and 7 cities now. Republics grow faster, so get a Conclave to level 6 and you'll probably win!

Third- you are likely to max out at 3-6 cities. And early game, don't be in a rush to go past 3 cities. With 3 well-run cities, you could win the game as a Republic.

Fourth- think carefully about whether you really need a fortress. Getting henchmen early and training them well can be an excellent substitute for the standing army you can't afford anyway. Unlike Champions, Henchmen don't split Xp with the sovereign. Load up a stack with henchmen and level them fast!

Fifth- Conclaves are your friend. See if you can get two up and growing early.

Sixth- Towns are almost as good as Conclaves for a republic. You'll miss the research, but even a town can produce solid research at level 5, which takes less time to reach as a Republic.
