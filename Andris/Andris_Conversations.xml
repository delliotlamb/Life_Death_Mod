    <Text>[L_LeaderName]. Arms and armor are our concern. You shall be protected by ours, or crushed under them. The choice is yours.</Text>
    <Text>Greetings, [L_LeaderName]. Every day our warriors become more skilled, and our craftsmen more fruitful. The Iru guide us.</Text>
    <Text>I have been to your capital, [L_LeaderName]. [L_CAPITAL_CITY] is a beautiful city. If only it was graced with the holy presence of the Iru, as [S_CAPITAL_CITY].</Text>
    <Text>Hail [L_LeaderName]! Rumor has it that [BEST_CHAMPION] is powerful over all others. But our armies fear no individual.</Text>
    <Text>I have come to warn you, [L_LeaderName]. Your capital is only [DISTANCE_L_CAPITAL] from a thing called [BEST_MONSTER]. Defense must come first.</Text>
    <Text>They say a Channeler can live for hundreds of years. I hope to talk with the Iru sages for centuries to come.</Text>
    <Text>The Spell of Making is part of the recently found book, "Book of Mastery". This knowledge would best be placed in the hands of Iru sages, not mortal men.</Text>
    <Text>We have [S_MONEY] gildar. You have [L_MONEY] gildar. But the Iru have little use for money.</Text>
    <Text>War is terrible. But victory makes men and their oaths stronger. Take care you win wars, not lose them.</Text>

    <Text>[L_LeaderName], your people can survive as servants to the Iru. Or you can be utterly destroyed. There is no in between.</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName]. I confess I have imagined what war between us would be like. I would win.</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName]. I have been to your capital, [L_CAPITAL_CITY]. Once the perverse buildings have been torn down and temples to the Iru raised, it will be a nice place to visit.</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName]. Your quest for tribal power is doomed. Submit to our rule before we must march against you.</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName], we hear tales of the deeds of [BEST_CHAMPION]. If you see him, tell him to lay down his sword lest our armies bury him.</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName]. Your capital is only [DISTANCE_L_CAPITAL] leagues from the most foul monster we've discovered. It is called [BEST_MONSTER]. Stay away from it.</Text>
    <Text>They say the Forge of the Overlord commanded all the power of magic. If it is rebuilt, only the Iru can be trusted to watch over it.</Text>
    <Text>The Spell of Making is magic that was thought lost from the world. But Iru sages might discover its secrets. Our knights shall slay any who seek this knowledge beside them.</Text>
    <Text>We have [S_MONEY] gildar. You have [L_MONEY] gildar. Remember our might, [L_LeaderName].</Text>
    <Text>After the cataclysm, we held fast to our principles, and were slaughtered for it. Yet we have survived, and our resolve has grown only stronger.</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName]. The Titans are gone. They cannot protect you anymore.</Text>
