1. INSTALLATION

Step 0: Delete the old version, if any!

Step 1: Unpack the .rar file into your Legendary Heroes Mods folder.

"Documents > MyGames > LegendaryHeroes > Mods"

Step 2: Move the 'Life_Death_Gfx' folder to "Documents > MyGames > LegendaryHeroes > Mods > Gfx"

Step 3: Move the 'Life_Death_Data' folder to "Documents > MyGames > LegendaryHeroes > Mods > Data"

Step 4: Make sure "use mods" is selected in the games preference file. If not, toggle this setting and re-start the game.

Step 5: Delete "A_LHLIB_UnitStat_BG_vL" if you already have it installed elsewhere (comes with Children Of Storm, Demons & Wizards, etc.). Delete any previous versions if you have them.

Step 6: IF YOU DO NOT HAVE UNDEAD DLC: Delete the folder "z_Undead_2_point_0" if you do not have the Undead DLC installed. ERRORS ARE LIKELY if this is present without Undead DLC.

step 7: If you DO NOT have Parrotmath's River Bridge mod, I highly highly recommend it: http://forums.elementalgame.com/437206/page/1/

This mod expects the River Bridge mod to be installed. There will be bugs without it. 

If you DO NOT WANT TO USE the River Bridge mod, then delete "Undead_2_Improvements.xml" and open up "Undead_2_Improvements_NO_RB.xml". Delete the "<!--" at the top of the file. Then delete the "-->" at the bottom. Save.

This will prevent bugs.

2. COMPATIBILITY

This mod is compatible with Children Of Storm, Black Market Bazaar, Champion Bonanza, any of Parrotmath's mods. 

It is NOT tested for compatibility with Demons and Wizards. Much of it should work, but since I have not tested this, expect significant bugs if you run both.

This mod is NOT compatible with XtraDecontrust. THEY WILL NOT play well together. HOWEVER XtraDeconstruct contains major parts of this mod as plug-ins. So if you want XtraDecontrust, you can get a lot of this mod inside of that one.

This mod is NOT compatible with Patchwork mod. Any other mod not listed is likely not compatible. But feel free to ask me questions about any issues here:

3. CREDITS

Thanks to Brad and Derek and everyone at Stardock for making a great game. And Heavenfall, parrotmath, Primal_Savage, abob101, and all the modders that have helped me out.

Graphics are by Fsemprini. Additional graphics by Soronarr and Primal_Savage.

Thanks to hellions for adding paladin unitstat support to his Black Market Bazaar items. (download this mod! Black Market Bazaar and Champions Bonanaza are great!)

Particular thanks to Primal Savage for sharing his expertise in this game engine. The Curgen's Volcano spell is stolen from his mod XtraDeconstruct (which is awesome and you should also check out). Also I copied his idea of adding experience for champion's to all Cityhubs.

4. MAJOR CHANGES AND FEATURES

This mod contains many major additions to the game content, most of which should not require explanation. Below are some of the changes from the base game.

-Essence is more interesting: Essence now increases Unrest by 5% per essence point. You'll have to deal with more headache to get the benefit of essence. Zero essence cities are now a more sensible choice!
-Champions Plus: All Champions paths now give a free special ability.  Also, champions get an extra +10 to defense and dodge when defending (units normally only get +5 defense when passing a turn). 
-Bow and Crossbow boost: Archers (with bows) get an attack boost against unmounted enemies (+3 on horseback, +1 on wargback). Crossbows show up later in the tech tree, but can pierce armor. Thus bows are more powerful and nimble, but crossbows are more reliable against heavily armored targets.
-New trained troop equipment: Oil jugs. Jugs can be thrown like molotov cocktails (costing gold), while archers can fire volleys that set the battlefield on fire.
-Assassin Plus: The assassin always goes first in combat, and can "sneak" into any position to make an attack with +50 critical chance, or instead can lay traps. Some existing abilities now have additional effects. The Executioner II ability now allows assassins to permanently kill champions (or even sovereigns) that are low in HP. If an enemy is casting the Spell Of Making, and you can't afford Curgen's Volcano, assassins can save your butt! ALSO: AI assassins can use this ability, so take great care!
-Refined Arcana: This was a tech in the vanilla game I found overpowered. It now increases mana production by only 10%, so teching up to Ereog's Journal is a clear advantage.
-Top tier shard shrines (temples): Shard Temples (tier 3) now produce +2 mana compared to shrines (tier 2). They ALSO increase your faction's mana production by 10%. This makes the tech "Ereog's Journal" more rewarding and a viable alternative to multiple researches of refined arcana (unlike before).
-Logistics and Company: the keys to powerful armies. I added some economic penalties to these techs, so there is a more meaningful choice between seeking the top end of the civilization tree and the warfare tree. Refined Economics and Agriculture can offset these penalties over time.
-Spell Scaling rebalance: spells like Slow, Wither, Haste, and Flame Dart scale less effectively with shards and levels. Flame Dart does more base damage now, however, meaning it is useful right from the start. Flame tongue and Soul Spark do slightly less damage (Leveled companies of trained troops can still do crazy high damage with them).
-Blizzard nerfed: It can still do crippling damage to clumped units of 6 members. It is now less likely to win battles with one cast, preventing the chances of blizzard trivializing late-game combat.
-Mage nerfed: mages were just too good. The Evoker ability line now induces hit point penalties, making Mages easy prey for enemy ranged units. Keep them alive and they can retain their battle-winning role.
-Spell Boosts: Shockwave is now useful, knocking enemies prone unless they resist. Chaos and pandemonium are now more effective, doing greater damage when applicable.
-Normal Weapon damage reduction: The top tier of weapons now do less damage (trained troop weapons only). They are less likely to one-shot heroes, and Pikes do significantly less damage to offset their armor piercing. Heroes are still very, very vulnerable to a company of soldiers wielding weapons. Swarm bonuses still make a huge difference! Also, magical staves do less damage so they don't trivialize the game (in the vanilla release, they a little too close to a 'win button').
-Elemental Lords: They are now MUCH harder to defeat. If you attack without resistance to their primary element, expect heavy losses even if you win. Try to soften up elemental lord and their armies with strategic spells first, or you stand little chance.
-Terraforming: As a champion progresses up the elemental trait tree, they gain the ability to change the landscape. Making more hill and mountain will gain the favor of earth, unlocking more spell options. But Air won't like this, and those options will be blocked for air spells. Likewise Fire and Life can be in opposition, Water and Earth. Pay attention to spells descriptions.
-When your sovereign reaches level 15, a new spell unlocks that allows them to search for the old Forge of the Overlord. This is a second master quest and VERY VERY HARD, you've been warned! 
-The Undead are much, much better now. They might be TOO GOOD as a playable faction, but I took this risk to make them a competitive AI player. 
-Andris faction: The Yithril of kingdoms. Can use their Iru units to heal and compensate for the army's lack of ranged combat with magic.
-Usaimor faction: Trogs that are more about versatile tactics and strategy than brute force. Don't worry, winning as Usaimor is still all about going on the offensive!
-Palranis faction: This faction is about having very tough units. Build trial pits and sacrifice your economy to built hard-hitting, tough units and/or Apexor units, which are like Sions but don't require a technology or Fame. Apexors can choose paths - don't forget the power of Commanders!
-New improvements, many many new items, new champions, many new spells and abilities, new icons!
-Scenario coming soon!
